About
-----

TinyThread++ is a minimalist, portable, threading library for C++, intended to
make it easy to create multi threaded C++ applications.

The library is closesly modeled after the current C++0x standard (draft), but
only a subset is implemented at the moment.

The library contains the following threading primitives: thread, mutex, and
condition_variable.


Using TinyThread++
------------------

To use TinyThread++ in your own project, just add tinythread.cpp and
tinythread.h to your project.
